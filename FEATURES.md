## Transcriptions

### Transcription Results
The results we get with Whisper are significantly better than other Speech-to-Text model (including Google, AWS
etc.) out there **and the models are free to use**. According to OpenAI, the models have been trained on data in 98
different languages (cca. 65% of data in English) **and show strong Automated Speech Recognition results in ~10 
languages**. More technical blabla on the 
<a href="">
[OpenAI Whisper Github](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/model-card.md) or the 
[Scientific Paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf), for hardcore enthusiasts. 

The magic takes over even for the most difficult noisy low bitrate stuff you can feed it - like recordings of your
assistant editor complaining about you without realizing that their back pocket is sending voice messages to random
people from their contacts list.

The results are really good for at least 10 languages, but remember, this is a machine doing transcriptions for you. 
And machines, just like unpaid interns have dreams too... For example, on longer periods of silence in your audio, you
may expect to see words that aren't there. Also, for uncommon names, it might give you nicknames instead, just to
mess with your feelings.

### Transcription Speed
We used the expression "runs like butter" above. There's one thing you need to know about butter - it's good when it's
fresh, but when it gets old it might get clumpy and smelly. Similar, the more state-of-the-art your machine CPU or
GPU is, the faster you get results. Please don't use this on your grandpa's Pentium 4 from the closet.

**Totally unscientific anecdotal tests:**

**Macbook Pro M1 8-core 16GB RAM** - 30-second timeline transcribed in cca. 45 seconds (1.5x time length of audio)

**Windows Workstation with GTX1070** - 60-second timeline transcribed in cca. 20 seconds (0.25x time length of audio)

We also received reports of transcriptions on RTX GPUs needing around 0.05-0.10x the time of the audio. So if you're
editing faster than that, please stop, you're embarrassing the rest of us.

### Quick how-to transcribe:

The following process assumes that you have Davinci Resolve Studio installed (not the free version of Resolve). 
However, **the tool also works independently without Resolve on the machine**.

#### 1. Open Resolve and StoryToolkitAI
Open a project in Resolve and then StoryToolkitAI
(or the other way around... why not make it harder for yourself?)

#### 2. Open the Timeline and Press Transcribe 

Go to Resolve and open the Timeline that you want to transcribe, then click the "Transcribe Timeline" button.

#### 3. Wait a bit

Your current timeline will automatically render to Audio Only WAV, and then a window with the transcription settings
will pop up. 

Enter the transcription settings (more info about settings 
[here](https://github.com/octimot/StoryToolkitAI#transcription-settings)) and then hit "Start".

Once the process has started, it needs a bit of time to transcribe. After all, there is a human-like AI trapped in your
machine doing your job for you on a mechanical typewriter with missing keys... It has the right to have day-dreams too.

As soon as it's done, the transcription will be saved on your machine.

_Important Note: **The first time you transcribe something**, it will take a bit longer to start the process
because Whisper needs to download the model file (around 1.5GB for the medium model) to your local cache. But, after 
the model is saved on your machine, transcriptions will take less._

#### 4. Transcription Finished
When the transcription is ready, a Transcription Window will pop up, showing you the transcript and allowing you to do
all sorts of magic things, like:
- linking the transcript to the current Resolve timeline
  (which will automatically open the transcript whenever you open the timeline in resolve)
- importing the generated SRT file into the current Resolve bin. 
- searching words or concepts in the transcript
- clicking on phrases to take your Resolve playhead on the right timecode
- etc.

_Less Important Note: Please make sure you sit down and have a glass of fresh water next to you when you see your first
transcription using OpenAI Whisper. Don't worry, the water coming down your cheeks are tears of joy. In the likely case
of hyperventilation, take a deep long breath and drink a bit of water. But, yet again, if the transcription is not above
average, don't despair, it's better to be prepared than sorry._

---

### Transcription Settings
Before starting the transcription process, you can tweak different options, including selecting the source language of
the footage, choosing between different Whisper models, the processing device, etc. For faster and better results,
we recommend at least selecting the source language.

_Note: when selecting "transcribe+translate" as "task", the tool will add both a transcription and a translation job to
the queue, as if you selected them individually. The translation will not use the previous transcription process results
at all, so this means that the process will take 2x the processing time._

For details regarding the models and their performance, please check 
[this section from the OpenAI Whisper repo](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages).
Also, keep in mind that if you're transcribing on a CUDA device, you need minimum 5GB of VRAM for the medium model, and
minimum 10GB for the large model.

**Initial Prompt**. This is useful if you want the
transcription algorithm to adopt a certain style (for eg. separating speaker sentences, or using caps after 
punctuation), or even prime it to use certain names (for eg. "Helena" instead of "Elena"), or avoid rookie mistakes 
(for eg. showing "Hey, Wood!" instead of "Heywood"). The default prompt separates speaker sentences and uses caps after 
punctuation. 
Remember: this is kind of like telling your assistant editor "do that", but it's up to them if they want to follow your 
instructions or not - welcome to the wonderful world of AI. This feature is super experimental - it might even accept
instructions like "separate speakers" or "make me coffee", but you have to try it on your own.

**Pre-Detect Speech** - when enabled, the tool will try to detect speech-only parts in the audio and send only those
parts to AI for transcription. This reduces the transcription time, but should also help avoid hallucinations on 
silent parts of the audio. However, the AI might lose context from one speech segment to the next, so the quality
of the transcription might take a hit.

**Increased Time Precision** adds more precision to the transcription timestamps, but it increases the processing time.
For best results, we recommend using the large model with this option enabled.

**Max. Characters per Line** and **Max. Words per Line** make the tool split the transcript segments at the specified
number of characters or words. This is useful if you want to make sure that the transcript segments are not too long,
but since there's no AI involved in this process (yet), the tool might split sentences in the weirdest places.
When both options are set, the Max. Characters per Line takes precedence. 
Only works if Increased Time Precision is enabled.

**Split on Punctuation** (version 0.17.19) splits the transcript lines at punctuation marks (. ! ? â€¦)
This might not always be the best option, for eg. if your text contains many abbreviations (Dr., Mr. etc.),
but you could still activate it and then manually fix the transcript afterwards. We're looking for ways to improve this 
using AI. 
Only works if Increased Time Precision is enabled.

**Prevent Gaps Shorter Than** (version 0.17.19) allows you to specify a minimum duration for the gaps between transcript 
segments. If the gap between two segments is shorter than the specified duration, the end time of the previous segment 
will be extended to the start time of the next segment. This is useful especially if you want to avoid having too many 
small gaps when using the transcript for subtitles.

**Time Intervals** allows you to selectively transcribe only a portion of the timeline and Exclude Time Intervals allows 
you to exclude certain portions of the timelines. The recommended format for these two fields is: "0.00 - 0.00".
For eg., if you want to transcribe the first 10 seconds of the audio and the portion between 30 and 40 seconds, 
you would enter this in the Time Intervals field:
```
0.00 - 10.00
30.00 - 40.00
```

#### Resolve "transcription_WAV" Preset

If you're transcribing timelines directly from Resolve and prefer to save them in WAV instead of MOV,
go to the Resolve Render Page, select the Audio Only preset, make sure that the "Export Video" in the Video tab is
disabled, then, in the "Audio" tab, select the "Wave" format and "Linear PCM" as codec. Then save this preset as
"transcription_WAV", and the next time you transcribe, you should see Resolve rendering wav files.

As a matter of fact, you can use any preset you want, as long as it renders audio too (Linear PCM preferred). For eg., 
if you want to render out an H264 proxy and include Data Burn-In with timecode info, 
just create that preset in Resolve and then modify the value of the 'transcription_render_preset' setting in the 
StoryToolkitAI config.json file in your user data folder (in the future, this will be editable from the GUI). Just keep 
in mind that before going through the transcription process, the tool will re-interpret the audio internally as Linear 
PCM (and you might need ffmpeg on your machine for that), so if you're using a CPU-intense codec, the process might 
take longer.

Another important thing to note is that your **audio channels are best left as Mono on your timeline and/or renders**, 
since the algorithm may ignore one channel or the other, and therefore only give you a partial transcription.

### Re-transcribing Transcripts

In some instances you might want to re-transcribe a transcript, for example if you want to change the Whisper model,
or if the speech was in a different language for that particular portion of the transcript.

To re-transcribe the entire transcript, you need to have the transcription window open, and then press the key T on 
your keyboard.

To re-transcribe only a portion of the transcript, select which segments you want to re-transcribe, and then press the
key T on your keyboard - the tool will automatically fill the Time Intervals field in the Transcription Settings window.

You can also not select any segments, but press the key T and then manually enter the time intervals that you want
re-transcribed in the Time Intervals field.

_Note: our tests show that re-transcribing only a short portion of the transcript sometimes doesn't give out the best
results and most likely messes up with the transcript timings for that particular portion that you've re-transcribed. 
This is probably due to the fact that the Whisper model works better when it has more context to work with.
In these cases, try to use either a larger model, or provide Whisper with more info using the Initial Prompt. Let us
know what tricks you use to get the best results!_

### Transcript Word Find
Once a transcript is loaded, a basic find function (CMD/CTRL+F) will let you find words in the transcript and show you 
their position. Press "ENTER" to cycle between results. Once you find what you're looking for, simply clicking the 
phrase will move the Resolve playhead to the respective timecode (if connected to Resolve API).

### Transcript Groups

Starting with v0.17.5, you can group transcript segments together so that you can easily select them later if you need
to. To add segments to groups, select them with V (or CMD/CTRL+Click, or other selection shortcuts) and then press 
CMD/CTR+G. To see the group list for each transcript, click CMD/CTRL+G while in the transcription window. From there,
you can also add group notes for each group. For eg. if you group certain segments on a certain topic, you can add
your notes on that particular topic in the group notes field. You can also use the groups to select all the segments
of a certain character and so on.

_Note: the groups are based on time intervals, so if you change the start or end times of segments, they might drift
outside of certain groups that they're in. Simply click on the group, select the segments and press CMD/CTR+G again to
re-add them to the group_

In the future, we will add the ability to perform an advanced search on one on more groups.

Also, we will most likely have a few features which will auto-group segments together (for eg. character recognition,
topic classification, Resolve / NLE markers to group segments, etc.)

### Direct Translations to English
The tool also supports direct translation to English by clicking the "Translate Timeline to English" button. However,
it will not generate any original language transcription together with the translation, meaning that you'll have to
transcribe and translate in two different processes.

### Opening SRT Files as Transcripts
(only available in non-standalone version until next release)
If you click on "Open Transcript" and select an SRT file, the tool will automatically convert it to a transcription
file and open it in the transcription window. This is useful if you want to use transcripts made by other apps in the
tool, for eg. to search through them, navigate and mark timelines in Resolve etc.

## Advanced Transcript Search
Transcription windows have an "Advanced Search" button that will open up a separate search window. The system is now
quite experimental and very raw, but it will allow you to search transcripts almost like you search something on Google.
This means that whenever you enter your search term, the tool will try to understand its meaning and find the phrases
that have the most similar meaning. The results will be ranked by a score that takes into account the semantic
similarity with your search term. Once the results appear in the window, you can click them and the tool will select
the respective segment in the transcript and move the playhead to the respective timecode in Resolve (if connected).
CMD/CTRL+Click will select the segments in the transcript and allow you to mark them later in Resolve
(see Adding Markers section above).

There's also an Advanced Search button in the main window that will allow you to search in all the transcription and
text files you select. If you press Shift while clicking the button it will prompt you with a folder selection instead,
so you can actually feed it multiple transcription from different directories.

This is basically like having a search engine on your machine.

You can also pass multiple search terms, using the | (pipe) character to separate them. For example, if you want to
search for "about life events" or "about sports", you can enter `about life events | about sports` in the search field. 
The tool will then search for each term separately and return separate results for each term in the same search window.

If you want to tell the tool how many results you want to see, just use `[max_results]` at the beginning of the search,
for eg.: `[20] about life events | about sports`. This will return the top 20 results for each term.

For now, the search relies on punctuation in the transcripts/files to separate phrases and feed them to the algorithm, 
but this will be improved in a future update by allowing AI to look deeper into the text.

**The quality of your results will depend on the terms you use for search**. Just like on a web search engine, you should
be kind of specific, but not too specific about what you're searching. For eg., if you want to search for phrases where
your characters are talking about "genders", you should probably use "about genders". Simply typing "genders" in the
search box, will probably also include people names since the alghorithm will think that names are related to genders.

Keep in mind that we're using a very basic algorithm for now, so the results might not be perfect, but it can **already
give you some really good results** if you prompt it right - remember it's a neural network behind the thing!
Feel free to be as descriptive as you want in your search, and try to tweak the search terms until you get the results
you're looking for.

More info about the commands you can use in the Advanced Search window can be found with the `[help]` command.

_Important Note: **The first time you use this feature**, it will take a bit longer to start the process because the 
tool needs to download the model file (around 500MB) to your local cache. But, after the model is saved on your
machine, the search should work almost in real time._

_About search speed: the search is pretty fast, but it will depend on the size of the files you're searching. 
Using a lot of them will make the search slower, so a smaller transform model is recommended (more on that later). 
The first time you open a window and search something, it will take a while to turn the data  into something that the 
machine understands, but after the first search is completed, all other searches should work fast._

## Assistant

This feature is currently only available for Patreon Frequent Users and Producers -
more info on [patreon.com/StoryToolkitAI](https://www.patreon.com/StoryToolkitAI)

The Assistant is basically an interface to OpenAI ChatGPT (or gpt-3.5-turbo).

### Obtaining an OpenAI API Key

First, you need to have an OpenAI API key to use this feature. 
You can get one by signing up on [OpenAI.com](https://platform.openai.com/signup/), 
and then creating a new secret key on the [API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
Make sure you keep this key safe, as it will allow anyone to use your OpenAI account on your expense!

Once you have the key, just add it in Preferences -> OpenAI API Key. 
This will be saved locally on your machine, so only people who have access to your machine will be able to see it.

### Usage and billing

Depending on the account you have with OpenAI, you might be charged for using the API, most likely using the token 
system they have in place. For more info on how OpenAI billing works, 
please check their [pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing/).
StoryToolkitAI is not responsible for any charges you might incur by using the Assistant, 
and we are not affiliated with OpenAI in any way.

To find out how many tokens you've used within the Assistant window, just type `[usage]` in the Assistant window
and you'll get a cost estimate. Again, this is just an estimate, so you should check your 
[OpenAI Usage page](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage) to see the actual cost.

### Assistant window

You can access the Assistant either by clicking on "Assistant" in the main tool window, or from a Transcription Window. 
(available only in version 0.17.18)

If you want to use a certain portion of the transcript as the context for the Assistant:
1. Open the transcription
2. Select the lines that you want to send to the Assistant using the 'v' key
3. Press Key O (not zero) to send the selected lines to the Assistant. You can also use SHIFT+O to also include the 
times or timecodes (if Resolve is connected) together with the lines to the Assistant.
4. The Assistant window will open and you can start typing your questions.

More info on the Assistant can be found by typing `[help]` in the Assistant window.

### Quick tips for using the Assistant

The possibilities here are endless. Feel free to use natural language to ask anything.
You can use the Assistant to:
- Ask questions about the transcript (characters, locations, events, etc)
- Summarize (try typing `tldr;`)
- Deduct certain things from the transcript (try typing `what is the main conflict?`)
- Understand the emotional tone of the transcript (try typing `how is the tone?`, `what makes this scene sad?`, `are the characters polite to each other?` etc.)
- Get ideas about what to ask the characters (try typing `what should I ask the character?`)
- Get ideas about possible outlines (try typing `outline the plot described in the transcript, each line should be a scene`)
- Get ideas about possible storylines (try typing `what is the main storyline?`)
- Even get you a .srt subtitle file (after sending transcript lines with times (SHIFT+O) try typing `subtitle this in .srt format`)
- Ask about the deepest black hole in the universe (try typing `what is the meaning of life?`)
- Anything else you can think of!..

Also remember to use `[reset]` as often as you can, so that you don't send the whole conversation to the Assistant 
over and over again, unless you're trying to follow something relevant from the previous messages.

## Davinci Resolve Studio integrations

_Note: The Resolve API integration is not available on the Free version of Resolve, you need to have a working Studio 
license installed on your machine to use this feature._

### Linking Transcriptions to Timelines
In the transcription window, the "Link" button will attach the transcription to the currently opened timeline in
Resolve. This will make the tool automatically open the right transcription when you switch between timelines in
Resolve. In a future update, this will also help the Global Search function know in which timeline, at what timecode
you can find the term you're looking for.

### Timeline Navigation via Transcript
Clicking on the transcript segments (phrases) will move the playhead to the respective timecode in Resolve.
UP/DOWN keys will also let you navigate between transcript phrases (see more transcription window shortcuts below)

### Adding Markers to Timeline via Transcript
You can now add markers that include the selected phrases in the transcript by pressing either M or SHIFT+M
(see more shortcuts below)

### Resolve Playhead to Transcript Sync
The tool highlights the transcript words at the current timecode in Resolve. To activate this function, simply press
"sync" in the transcription window and the words will be highlighted each time the playhead stops moving in Resolve.

_Note: we found some issues when synching timelines that have a frame rate of 23.976fps because of a bug in the Resolve
API. Unfortunately, the synching of these timelines might drift until Blackmagic solves the bug._

### Copy Timeline Markers to Same Clip
This copies the current markers to its corresponding clip in the media bin. 
Due to Resolve API limitations, it's important that the corresponding clip
is in the bin that is currently opened in the Media Panel. 
The clip's existing markers will be deleted before the new ones are copied!

### Copy Clip Markers to Same Timeline
Same as the function above, but in this case, the markers of the clip are copied to the timeline.

### Render Markers to Stills
This will render to TIFF and JPEG the first frame of the markers of a certain color or ones that start with a certain 
string. Works only on markers from the opened timeline. The first time you use this function, it should also add a 
Still_TIFF render preset in Resolve. This is necessary to render the stills in TIFF format, which then should get 
converted to JPEG if you have FFMPEG on your machine.

### Render Markers to Clips
This will render to H.264 the entire duration of the markers of a certain color or that start with a certain string 
from your currently opened Resolve timeline.
